compare_distributions(d1, d2)

\arguments{
\item{d1}{A distribution object}

\item{d2}{A distribution object}
}
\value{
This function returns
\describe{
\item{\code{test_statistic}}{The test statistic.}
\item{\code{p_one_sided}}{A one-sided p-value, which is an upper limit
on getting that small a log-likelihood ratio if the
first distribution, \code{d1}, is actually true.}
\item{\code{p_two_sided}}{A two-sided p-value, which is the probability
of getting a log-likelihood ratio which deviates that much from zero
in either direction, if the two distributions are actually equally good.}
\item{\code{ratio}}{A data frame with two columns. The first column is
the \code{x} value and second column is the difference in
log-likelihoods.}}
}
\description{
Since it is possible to fit power law models to any data set,
it is recommended that alternative distributions are considered.
A standard technique is to use Vuong's test.
This is a likelihood ratio test for model selection using the
Kullback-Leibler criteria.
The test statistic, \code{R}, is the ratio of the
log-likelihoods of the data between the two competing models.
The sign of \code{R} indicates which model is better.
Since the value of \code{R} is estimated,
we use the method proposed by Vuong, 1989 to select the model.
}
\details{
This function compares two models.
The null hypothesis is that both classes of distributions are
equally far from the true distribution.  If this is true, the
log-likelihood ratio should (asymptotically) have a Normal distribution
with mean zero. The test statistic is the sample average of the
log-likelihood ratio, standardized by a consistent estimate of its standard
deviation.
If the null hypothesis is false, and one class of distributions is
closer to the "truth", the test statistic goes to +/-infinity
with probability 1, indicating the better-fitting class of distributions.
