Title: Fitting power laws to discrete and continuous data
Version: 0.14.1
Date: 2012-11-29
Author: Colin Gillespie
Maintainer: Colin Gillespie <colin.gillespie@newcastle.ac.uk>
Description: This package implements both the discrete (and in the near
    future continuous) maximum likelihood estimators for fitting the
    power-law distribution to data. Additionally, a goodness-of-fit based
    approach is used to estimate the lower cut-off for the scaling region.
    The code developed in this package has
    been heavily influnenced from the python and R code found at:
    http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/ . In particular, the R code of
    Laurent Dubroca.
