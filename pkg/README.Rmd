# The poweRlaw package

This package implements both the discrete and continuous maximum likelihood estimators for fitting the power-law distribution to data using the methods described in [Clauset et al, 2009](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062). It also provides function to fit log-normal and Poisson distributions. Additionally, a goodness-of-fit based approach is used to estimate the lower cut-off for the scaling region. 

The code developed in this package was influenced from the python and R code found at [Aaron Clauset's website](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/). In particular, the R code of Laurent Dubroca and Cosma Shalizi.

Installation
------------

This package is hosted on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poweRlaw/) and can be installed in the usual way:
```{r, eval =FALSE}
install.packages("poweRlaw")
```
Alternatively, the development version can be install from from github using the devtools package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("csgillespie/poweRlaw", sub = "pkg")
```

Note Windows users have to first install [Rtools](http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/).

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, load the package
```{r}
library("poweRlaw")
```
then work the through the four vignettes (links to the current CRAN version): 

 * [Getting started](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poweRlaw/vignettes/a_introduction.pdf)
 * [Worked examples](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poweRlaw/vignettes/b_powerlaw_examples.pdf)
 * [Comparing distributions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poweRlaw/vignettes/c_comparing_distributions.pdf)
 * [JSS paper](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poweRlaw/vignettes/d_jss_paper.pdf)

Alternatively, you can access the vignettes from within the package:
```{r, eval =FALSE}
browseVignettes("poweRlaw")
```
The plots below show the line of best fit to the Moby Dick and blackout data sets (from Clauset et al, 2009).
